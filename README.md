According to the document, The network takes in an image and gives output a probability (score between 0-1) which can be used to filter not suitable for work images. Scores < 0.2 indicate that the image is likely to be safe with high probability. Scores > 0.8 indicate that the image is highly probable to be NSFW. Scores in middle range may be binned for different NSFW levels.
